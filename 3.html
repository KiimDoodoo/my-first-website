<h2>Javascript</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated JS</a>, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

  JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
